Problem: 
Coffee lovers, haters, and novices alike all need a way to sort through the superfluous 
influx of information provided by both the coffee industry itself as well as the internet.
I couldn't find anywhere online to act as such a filter, so I created Coffee Community.
Solution:
Coffee Community is a web application that allows users to search for coffee via a relatively 
simple search system. It also allows users to tag coffee, which is useful for general filtration 
of the coffees they are potentially searching for. Another feature is the user preference list.
The user preference list allows the user to keep track of specific coffee that the proverbial user
likes by adding it to a list the the user dictates.
Users cal also collectively rate the Collection of coffee.

Version: CoffeeCommunity-0.0.1
